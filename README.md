# UART-System-verilog-and-Verification-
A sophisticated digital verification project demonstrating expertise in modern verification methodologies. This UART verification system showcases my ability to design and implement complete verification environments from scratch, including testbench architecture, constrained-random testing, functional coverage, and scoreboard-based checking.
